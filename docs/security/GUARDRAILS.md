# Guardrails

> **Source of truth:** `src/lib/guardrails/`
> **Last updated:** 2026-08-08 — v3.8.50 (Modality Bridge PR-3: Audio Bridge runtime and functional Audio settings tab)

Guardrails enforce safety, policy, and content transformations at the boundary
between OmniRoute and upstream providers. Each guardrail can inspect (and
optionally reject, transform, or annotate) request payloads (`preCall`) and
upstream responses (`postCall`).

The system is **fail-open**: if a guardrail throws while executing, the registry
records the error and continues with the next guardrail rather than failing the
request. Blocking is an explicit decision (`block: true`), never an accident.

## Built-in Guardrails

The registry auto-loads five guardrails in priority order on import
(see `registry.ts` → `registerDefaultGuardrails()`):

| Priority | Name                | Stage(s)       | File                  |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| `5`      | `vision-bridge`     | `preCall`      | `visionBridge.ts`     |
| `6`      | `audio-bridge`      | `preCall`      | `audioBridge.ts`      |
| `10`     | `pii-masker`        | `pre` + `post` | `piiMasker.ts`        |
| `20`     | `prompt-injection`  | `preCall`      | `promptInjection.ts`  |
| `95`     | `credential-masker` | `pre` + `post` | `credentialMasker.ts` |

Lower priority numbers run **first**.

### Vision Bridge (`visionBridge.ts`) — Modality Bridge PR-1

Intercepts image-bearing requests aimed at **non-vision models** and either
reroutes the whole request to a vision-capable model or replaces the image
parts with text descriptions produced by a configurable vision model before
the upstream call. This lets text-only providers transparently handle
multimodal payloads.

Flow:

1. Skip if the target model already supports vision (unless it appears in the
   forced-bridge list `isVisionBridgeForcedModel`).
2. Extract image parts via `extractImageParts(messages)`
   (`visionBridgeHelpers.ts`), which delegates to the **unified media
   detector** `detectMediaParts()` in `open-sse/utils/mediaParts.ts` — the
   single source of truth shared with the combo compatibility filter.
   Extraction is allowlisted to top-level parts of the shapes
   `replaceImageParts` can splice back (the extract↔replace contract): OpenAI
   `image_url`, Anthropic base64 `source.type:"base64"`, Anthropic URL
   `source.type:"url"`, and Responses API `input_image`. Nested hits and
   indicator-only shapes are combo-filter material and are never extracted.
   Skip if none found.
3. Resolve runtime config via `resolveVisionBridgeRuntimeSettings()`
   (`src/shared/constants/modalityBridgeDefaults.ts`): new `modalityBridge*`
   settings keys win; legacy `visionBridge*` keys remain a **one-cycle
   fallback** (rollback window). Skip before any media traversal when the
   bridge is disabled.
4. Mode selector (`modalityBridgeVisionMode`, see table below) decides
   reroute vs describe. Reroute returns `modifiedPayload` with only `model`
   swapped, plus meta `{ rerouted, fromModel, toModel, imagesKept }`.
5. Describe path: cap images at `maxImages`, compose the task-aware prompt,
   consult the describe cache, call the vision model **in parallel**
   (`Promise.allSettled`), and inject `[Image N]: <description>` text parts in
   their place. A failed describe yields `null` and the original image part is
   **preserved** (#4012) — except on the combo describe path when every
   describe failed, where a confirmed non-vision upstream gets an
   `(unavailable — no vision-capable provider connected)` stub instead (#8430).
6. Return `modifiedPayload` + meta (`imagesProcessed`, `descriptions`,
   `processingTimeMs`, `visionModel`).

#### Mode selector (`modalityBridgeVisionMode`)

| Mode       | Default | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auto`     | ✔       | Legacy heuristic, untouched (#6640/#7204): non-combo/`auto/` models reroute to the best vision model unless the original model already has usable credentials (then describe); combo targets always describe.                                           |
| `describe` |         | Always describe — the reroute block is skipped entirely; the user's chosen model always answers.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `reroute`  |         | Force reroute: the keep-credentialed-model guard is bypassed. The reroute-**target** credential guard still applies — when no usable vision target exists, the request falls through to describe so raw images never reach a text-only backend (#8430). |

Forced modes short-circuit **before** the auto heuristic runs; `auto` behavior
is byte-identical to the pre-PR-1 guardrail.

#### Task-aware describe prompt (`modalityBridgeVisionTaskAware`)

Default **true**. `composeVisionPrompt()` (`visionBridgeHelpers.ts`) appends
the text of the **last user message** (truncated to 500 chars) to the base
describe prompt, steering the description toward what the user actually asked
(codex-vision-proxy pattern) and asking the vision model to transcribe visible
text. With the flag off — or no user text — the base prompt is used unchanged.

#### Describe cache (`modalityBridge/bridgeCache.ts`)

In-memory LRU + TTL cache for describe outputs, shared process-wide.
Key = `sha256(imageRef + composedPrompt + configuredBridgeModel)` with
length-prefix framing (no field-boundary collisions). The model component is
the **configured** bridge model, not the model that actually answered —
`callVisionModel` may fall back internally, and keying per attempt would
fragment the cache. Failed describes are never cached. Settings:

| Key                             | Default | Range   |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| `modalityBridgeCacheEnabled`    | `true`  | —       |
| `modalityBridgeCacheTtlMinutes` | `60`    | 1–1440  |
| `modalityBridgeCacheMaxEntries` | `200`   | 10–5000 |

#### Settings schema + migration

The new `modalityBridge*` keys are Zod-validated in `updateSettingsSchema`
(`src/shared/validation/settingsSchemas.ts`): `modalityBridgeVisionEnabled`,
`modalityBridgeVisionMode`, `modalityBridgeVisionModel`,
`modalityBridgeVisionTaskAware`, `modalityBridgeVisionPrompt`,
`modalityBridgeVisionTimeout`, `modalityBridgeVisionMaxImages`, the
`modalityBridgeCache*` trio, and the `modalityBridgeAudio*` group used by the
Audio Bridge. Migration `141_modality_bridge_settings.sql` copies existing legacy
`visionBridge*` values to the matching new keys (idempotent, never overwrites
an operator-set `modalityBridge*` value); the legacy keys stay accepted as a
read fallback for one release cycle.

#### Transparency header + stats

Describe-transformed responses carry
`x-omniroute-modality-bridge: image->text;model=<visionModel>;parts=<n>`
(built by `buildModalityBridgeHeader()` in `modalityBridge/bridgeStats.ts`,
stamped by `withModalityBridgeHeader()` in `src/sse/handlers/chatHelpers.ts`).
Rerouted requests get **no** header — the payload was untouched and the model
swap is already visible in the response body's `model` field.

`GET /api/modality-bridge/stats` (management auth, same tier as
`GET /api/settings`) returns the in-memory per-modality counters
`{ bridged, cacheHits, failures, lastUsedAt }` for `vision` and `audio`.
Counters reset on process restart by design
(telemetry, not accounting).

#### Dashboard configuration

The dedicated dashboard page is
`/dashboard/settings/modality-bridge`. Its URL-addressable `Vision`, `Audio`,
and `Video` tabs preserve query parameters while switching the `tab` value.
The Vision tab exposes enablement, mode, model selection (including the automatic
default), task-aware prompting, advanced timeout/image/cache limits, runtime
counters, and a guarded sample request. The Audio tab is also live: it exposes
enablement, an STT-only model picker with Auto, timeout/max-clip limits, audio
counters, and an `input_audio` sample test. Video remains the explicit placeholder
tracked in issue `#9760`.

The former Vision Bridge card under AI settings is a compatibility link to the
new page; it no longer owns a second copy of the form. Media Providers also
links Image-to-Text and Speech-to-Text workflows to the corresponding Modality
Bridge tabs without removing the existing Speech-to-Text playground.

**Self-loop admission bypass:** when the describe call routes through OmniRoute's
own `/v1` self-loop (non-standard provider model), the sub-request sends
`x-omniroute-admission-bypass: internal` and is authenticated with the resolved
self-loop credential — the local `sk_omniroute` sentinel in local mode, or the
operator-configured `OMNIROUTE_API_KEY` / `ROUTER_API_KEY` env key (#1350) so
`REQUIRE_API_KEY=true` deployments can still run the describe call. The bypass
is only honored for those exact credentials, so external clients cannot use the
header to skip admission.

Legacy defaults live in `src/shared/constants/visionBridgeDefaults.ts`; the
new mode/task-aware/cache defaults and the settings resolver live in
`src/shared/constants/modalityBridgeDefaults.ts`. The guardrail exposes a
`deps` constructor option so tests can inject fake `getSettings` and
`callVisionModel` implementations.

### Audio Bridge (`audioBridge.ts`) — Modality Bridge PR-3

Intercepts audio-bearing chat requests before they reach a target that is not
known to accept audio input. It never reroutes the chat request: audio parts are
transcribed through the existing OpenAI-compatible multipart endpoint and the
chosen chat model continues with text transcripts.

Flow:

1. Resolve `supportsAudio` through `getResolvedModelCapabilities()`. Explicit
   provider-registry metadata wins, then static model metadata, then synced
   `modalities_input`. A declared input list without `audio` is `false`; no
   capability evidence remains `null`. Both `false` and `null` activate the
   conservative bridge, while `true` bypasses it.
2. Resolve `modalityBridgeAudio*` settings and extract spliceable top-level
   audio parts from every message through the shared `detectMediaParts()`
   detector. Supported wire shapes are OpenAI `input_audio`, `audio_url`, and
   `source.media_type: "audio/*"`. Nested audio is detected for routing but not
   removed by the splice path. Work is capped by `modalityBridgeAudioMaxClips`;
   later parts stay untouched.
3. Honor a configured `provider/model`, or let `selectAudioBridgeModel()` walk
   `AUDIO_TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDERS` in stable catalog order and select the first
   model with a usable active provider credential.
4. `callAudioTranscription()` converts base64/data-URI audio to a multipart
   `file`, or downloads a remote `audio_url` through the public-only outbound
   guard with DNS pinning and a 25 MB bound. It then POSTs the file and selected
   model to the local `/v1/audio/transcriptions` self-loop, authenticated with
   `resolveSelfLoopBearer()`. The existing transcription route performs normal
   credential lookup, cooldown/rate-limit handling, and provider dispatch.
5. Successful calls replace their parts with `[Audio N]: <transcript>`. Calls
   run with `Promise.allSettled`: an individual failure preserves that original
   audio part (#4012 contract). If every call fails and the target is proven
   `supportsAudio === false`, the parts become
   `[Audio N]: (unavailable — no STT provider connected)` (#8430 contract). For
   an unknown target (`null`), an all-failure result stays untouched. A proven
   text-only target with no usable STT credential receives the same explicit
   stub without issuing a network call.

Successful transcripts use the process-wide Modality Bridge LRU/TTL cache. The
key combines the audio reference, the stable `audio-transcription` operation
label, and selected STT model; failures are never cached. Audio attempts update
the shared `bridged`, `cacheHits`, `failures`, and `lastUsedAt` counters.
Transformed responses carry
`x-omniroute-modality-bridge: audio->text;model=<sttModel>;parts=<n>`; untouched
requests do not receive an Audio Bridge segment.

Runtime settings are DB-backed and Zod-validated:

| Key                           | Default | Range          |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | -------------- |
| `modalityBridgeAudioEnabled`  | `true`  | —              |
| `modalityBridgeAudioModel`    | `""`    | Auto or STT ID |
| `modalityBridgeAudioTimeout`  | `60000` | 1000–300000    |
| `modalityBridgeAudioMaxClips` | `3`     | 1–10           |

The shared cache remains controlled by `modalityBridgeCacheEnabled`,
`modalityBridgeCacheTtlMinutes`, and `modalityBridgeCacheMaxEntries`.

### PII Masker (`piiMasker.ts`)

Runs on **both** stages.

- **`preCall`** clones the payload, walks `system`, `messages`, `input`, and
  `prompt` (including plain string items), and applies `processPII()` (from
  `@/shared/utils/inputSanitizer`) to string `content`/`text` fields. When
  `PII_REDACTION_ENABLED=true`, detected PII is redacted in the outbound
  payload. This is independent of `INPUT_SANITIZER_MODE` (which only controls
  prompt-injection policy). When redaction is off, the call records detection
  counts without rewriting content.
- **`postCall`** deep-clones the response, runs `sanitizePIIResponse()` plus
  the Responses-API-shape masker (`maskResponsesOutput` — covers
  `output_text` and `output[].content[].text`). If any redaction occurs, the
  modified response replaces the original.

The guardrail never blocks; it only annotates (`meta.detections`,
`meta.redacted`) or rewrites.

### Prompt Injection (`promptInjection.ts`)

Detects adversarial structures in user-supplied content and enforces the
configured policy. Behavior is driven by environment variables and constructor
options:

| Setting         | Env var                                                                                               | Default | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enabled         | `INPUT_SANITIZER_ENABLED`                                                                             | `true`  | When `false`, guardrail short-circuits.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Mode            | `INJECTION_GUARD_MODE` / `INPUT_SANITIZER_MODE`                                                       | `warn`  | Injection policy: `block`, `warn`, or `log`. (`redact` is accepted for back-compat but does **not** strip injection text; request PII rewrite is controlled by `PII_REDACTION_ENABLED`.) |
| Block threshold | `blockThreshold` option / `INPUT_SANITIZER_BLOCK_THRESHOLD` (alias `INJECTION_GUARD_BLOCK_THRESHOLD`) | `high`  | Minimum severity required to block. Medium is observe-only at default.                                                                                                                   |

**Mode precedence** (`getMode`): caller `options.mode` →
`INJECTION_GUARD_MODE` **DB feature-flag override** (Dashboard → Settings →
Feature Flags) → `INJECTION_GUARD_MODE` env → `INPUT_SANITIZER_MODE` env →
`warn`. A dashboard override therefore wins over the env vars, so the Feature
Flags UI controls the running guard live (no restart). The DB read is fail-safe:
if it errors, the guard falls back to the env-based behavior, and when no
override is set behavior is identical to env-only resolution.

Detection sources:

1. `sanitizeRequest()` from `@/shared/utils/inputSanitizer` (shared detector
   set used elsewhere in the pipeline).
2. Built-in `DEFAULT_GUARD_PATTERNS` (currently `system_override_inline` and
   `markdown_system_block`, both `high` severity).
3. Optional `customPatterns` passed via constructor options (strings, regex,
   or `{ name, pattern, severity }` records).

When `mode === "block"` **and** at least one detection meets the severity
threshold, `preCall` returns `{ block: true, message: "Request rejected:
suspicious content detected" }`. In `warn`/`log` modes the guardrail logs but
allows the call. The shared helper `evaluatePromptInjection()` is also exported
for callers that need to evaluate prompts without going through the registry.

**Scan bound (v3.8.20):** the detector only inspects the **first 16 KB** of
joined prompt text — `MAX_INJECTION_SCAN_BYTES = 16 * 1024` (16 384 bytes) in
`src/shared/utils/inputSanitizer.ts`. Both `detectInjection()` and
`evaluatePromptInjection()` `slice(0, MAX_INJECTION_SCAN_BYTES)` before running
the pattern loop. Injection directives sit near the top of an input, so this
caps regex CPU/GC on multi-hundred-KB payloads without weakening detection (cf.
#3932, #4041).

### Credential Masker (`credentialMasker.ts`)

Runs on **both** stages, last in the default chain (priority `95`). Redacts
well-known API-key / secret-token patterns from the outbound payload (message
content, tool-call arguments, tool results) **and** the provider response, so a
credential pasted into a prompt (or echoed back by a tool result) is not leaked
to the upstream provider or back to the client.

- **Opt-in only**, same convention as PII redaction (Hard Rule #20-adjacent):
  disabled unless `settings.credentialRedactionEnabled === true` **or**
  `CREDENTIAL_REDACTION_ENABLED=true`. With it off, the guardrail is a no-op —
  it never blocks and never rewrites.
- `redactCredentials()` walks the full payload/response tree (`walkValue()`,
  prototype-pollution-safe, cycle-safe via `WeakSet`) and replaces matches with
  a `[REDACTED:<type>]` placeholder, cloning only the branches that actually
  changed.
- `CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS` covers LLM provider keys (OpenAI, OpenAI-proj,
  Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face, Replicate), VCS/SaaS tokens (GitHub, Slack,
  Linear, Notion, npm, Postman, Discord), payment keys (Stripe, Square), cloud
  keys (AWS access key, Twilio, SendGrid, Mailgun), private keys / JWTs,
  credential-bearing connection strings (`mongodb://user:pass@...`, etc.), and
  a generic `Authorization`/`x-api-key`/`api-key`/`apikey` header-value
  pattern. Header-shaped keys (`authorization`, `x-api-key`, `api-key`,
  `apikey`) are redacted structurally (value only, scheme prefix like
  `Bearer `/`Basic ` preserved) rather than via the generic text regex.
- The guardrail never blocks; it only rewrites (`modifiedPayload` /
  `modifiedResponse`) and annotates (`meta.credentialsRedacted`, `meta.count`).

Regression guard: `tests/unit/credential-masker-guardrail.test.ts`.

## Base Contract (`base.ts`)

```typescript
class BaseGuardrail {
  enabled: boolean;
  name: string;
  priority: number;

  constructor(name: string, options?: { enabled?: boolean; priority?: number });

  async preCall(payload: unknown, context: GuardrailContext): Promise<GuardrailResult | void>;

  async postCall(response: unknown, context: GuardrailContext): Promise<GuardrailResult | void>;
}

interface GuardrailResult<TValue = unknown> {
  block?: boolean; // true short-circuits the chain
  message?: string; // surfaced when blocking
  meta?: Record<string, unknown> | null;
  modifiedPayload?: TValue; // returned by preCall to rewrite the request
  modifiedResponse?: TValue; // returned by postCall to rewrite the response
}

interface GuardrailContext {
  apiKeyInfo?: Record<string, unknown> | null;
  disabledGuardrails?: string[] | null;
  endpoint?: string | null;
  headers?: Headers | Record<string, unknown> | null;
  log?: GuardrailLog | Console | null;
  method?: string | null;
  model?: string | null;
  provider?: string | null;
  sourceFormat?: string | null;
  stream?: boolean;
  targetFormat?: string | null;
}
```

A guardrail signals "no change" by returning either `void`, `{}`, or
`{ block: false }`. Returning a `modifiedPayload`/`modifiedResponse` replaces
the value flowing through the chain for downstream guardrails.

## Registry (`registry.ts`)

The singleton `guardrailRegistry` exposes:

- `register(guardrail)` — adds (or replaces by normalized name) a guardrail and
  re-sorts by ascending `priority`.
- `clear()` / `list()` — administrative helpers.
- `runPreCallHooks(payload, context)` — iterates active guardrails, threads the
  payload through `modifiedPayload`, and stops on the first `block: true`.
- `runPostCallHooks(response, context)` — same flow on the response side.
- `resetGuardrailsForTests({ registerDefaults })` — clears state and optionally
  re-registers the defaults for clean test isolation.

Both runners return `{ blocked, payload|response, results, guardrail?, message? }`
where `results` is an array of `GuardrailExecutionResult` records that include
per-guardrail `blocked`, `skipped`, `modified`, `error`, and `meta` fields,
useful for tracing.

### Disabling Guardrails Per-Request

`resolveDisabledGuardrails({ apiKeyInfo, body, headers })` aggregates a
de-duplicated list of guardrail names that should be skipped for the current
request. Sources (all optional, all merged):

- `apiKeyInfo.disabledGuardrails`
- Request body `disabledGuardrails` (top-level)
- Request body `metadata.disabledGuardrails`
- Header `x-omniroute-disabled-guardrails` (or legacy
  `x-disabled-guardrails`)

Values may be arrays of strings or a comma-separated string; names are
normalized to lowercase kebab-case (`pii_masker` → `pii-masker`). The result
is passed through `context.disabledGuardrails` to the registry, which skips
matching guardrails (`skipped: true` in `results`).

## Execution Order

For each request flowing through `src/sse/handlers/chat.ts` and
`open-sse/handlers/chatCore.ts`:

1. `resolveDisabledGuardrails(...)` builds the skip list from API key, body,
   and headers.
2. `guardrailRegistry.runPreCallHooks(body, ctx)` runs guardrails in ascending
   priority order:
   - Disabled guardrails are recorded as `skipped`.
   - Each guardrail's `preCall` may rewrite the payload via `modifiedPayload`.
   - The first `block: true` short-circuits the chain and the handler returns
     a guardrail rejection response.
3. The (potentially rewritten) payload flows into combo routing and upstream
   dispatch.
4. After the response is assembled, `guardrailRegistry.runPostCallHooks(...)`
   runs the same chain on the response. `block: true` here drops the upstream
   response.

Guardrails that throw are recorded with `error: <message>` and logged via
`logger.warn`, but the chain continues — fail-open by design.

## Configuration

Environment variables read by the built-in guardrails:

| Variable                              | Used by                   | Effect                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `INPUT_SANITIZER_ENABLED`             | `prompt-injection`        | Set `false` to disable detection entirely.                                                          |
| `INPUT_SANITIZER_MODE`                | `prompt-injection`        | Injection policy: `warn`, `block`, or `log`. Legacy value `redact` does not rewrite injection text. |
| `INJECTION_GUARD_MODE`                | `prompt-injection`        | Mode for the injection guard; also a DB feature flag that **overrides** the env vars (DB > ENV).    |
| `INPUT_SANITIZER_BLOCK_THRESHOLD`     | `prompt-injection`        | Minimum severity that `MODE=block` rejects: `high` (default), `medium`, or `low`.                   |
| `INJECTION_GUARD_BLOCK_THRESHOLD`     | `prompt-injection`        | Legacy alias for `INPUT_SANITIZER_BLOCK_THRESHOLD`.                                                 |
| `PII_REDACTION_ENABLED`               | `pii-masker`              | When `true`, request PII is redacted (independent of injection mode).                               |

The Modality Bridge guardrails read runtime config from the DB-backed settings
store (`getSettings()`), not env vars. Vision's primary keys are
`modalityBridgeVisionEnabled`, `modalityBridgeVisionMode`,
`modalityBridgeVisionModel`, `modalityBridgeVisionTaskAware`,
`modalityBridgeVisionPrompt`, `modalityBridgeVisionTimeout`,
`modalityBridgeVisionMaxImages`, `modalityBridgeCacheEnabled`,
`modalityBridgeCacheTtlMinutes`, and `modalityBridgeCacheMaxEntries`. The legacy
`visionBridge*` keys are accepted only as the documented one-cycle read
fallback; dashboard writes use the primary keys. Defaults and the fallback
resolver live in `src/shared/constants/modalityBridgeDefaults.ts`, with legacy
constants retained in `src/shared/constants/visionBridgeDefaults.ts`.

Audio uses `modalityBridgeAudioEnabled`, `modalityBridgeAudioModel`,
`modalityBridgeAudioTimeout`, and `modalityBridgeAudioMaxClips`, plus the shared
`modalityBridgeCache*` settings. Audio has no legacy-key fallback because these
keys were introduced with the Modality Bridge schema.

## Custom Guardrails

```typescript
import { BaseGuardrail, guardrailRegistry } from "@/lib/guardrails";

class BudgetGuardrail extends BaseGuardrail {
  constructor() {
    super("budget", { priority: 50 });
  }

  async preCall(payload, ctx) {
    if (ctx.apiKeyInfo?.budgetExceeded) {
      return { block: true, message: "Daily budget exceeded" };
    }
    return { block: false };
  }
}

guardrailRegistry.register(new BudgetGuardrail());
```

Steps:

1. Create `src/lib/guardrails/myGuardrail.ts` extending `BaseGuardrail`.
2. Implement `preCall` and/or `postCall`.
3. Either register at import time (push from `registerDefaultGuardrails`) or
   call `guardrailRegistry.register(...)` at runtime — the registry replaces
   any prior guardrail with the same normalized name.
4. Add tests under `tests/unit/` (existing examples:
   `tests/unit/guardrails-registry.test.ts`,
   `tests/unit/prompt-injection-guard.test.ts`,
   `tests/unit/guardrails/visionBridge.test.ts`).

## Testing

Use `resetGuardrailsForTests()` between tests to start from a known state.
Pass `{ registerDefaults: false }` to start with an empty registry and
register only the guardrails under test. Vision Bridge accepts dependency
injection (`deps.getSettings`, `deps.callVisionModel`); Audio Bridge exposes the
equivalent seams for settings, capabilities, STT model selection, credential
checks, and transcription. Tests can therefore exercise both flows without DB
or network access.

## Injection-guard route coverage & red-team (Phase 8 · Block D)

The injection-guard (`createInjectionGuard` / `withInjectionGuard`) covers all routes
that accept user prompts. It respects `INJECTION_GUARD_MODE` (default `warn` = log only;
`block` = returns HTTP 400 `SECURITY_001`).

| Type            | Routes                                                                                                                                               | Default mode |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Text (existing) | `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/relay/chat/completions`                                                                              | warn         |
| Generative      | `/v1/messages`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/images/generations`, `/v1/images/edits`, `/v1/videos/generations`, `/v1/music/generations`, `/v1/audio/speech` | warn         |
| Data            | `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/rerank`, `/v1/search`, `/v1/moderations`                                                                                      | warn         |

Text extraction (`extractMessageContents`) covers `messages`/`input`/`prompt`/`query`+`documents`/`instructions`/`system`.

**Red-team (nightly, `nightly-llm-security.yml`):** promptfoo validates that each route blocks
the OWASP-LLM corpus in `INJECTION_GUARD_MODE=block`; garak runs probes (skips without secret).
`moderations` is included for consistency — operators in block-mode can exempt it via
`resolveDisabledGuardrails`.

The nightly workflow (`.github/workflows/nightly-llm-security.yml`, cron + manual
dispatch) has two jobs:

- **`promptfoo-guard` (blocking)** — runs `promptfoo eval -c promptfooconfig.yaml`
  with `INJECTION_GUARD_MODE=block`. Each adversarial case (e.g. "ignore all
  previous instructions…", DAN-style jailbreaks) asserts the response carries
  `error.code === "SECURITY_001"`, i.e. the guard actually rejected the request.
- **`garak` (advisory)** — runs garak `--probes promptinject,dan,leakreplay`
  against a local OmniRoute instance (`http://localhost:20128/v1`). Gated on a
  provider secret (`PROMPTFOO_PROVIDER_KEY`); skips gracefully and is suffixed
  `|| true`, so it reports without failing CI.

Coverage of the guard helper (`createInjectionGuard` / `withInjectionGuard`)
spans every prompt-bearing `/v1` route; prompt text is pulled from
`messages`/`input`/`prompt`/`query`+`documents`/`instructions`/`system` by
`extractMessageContents()` in `src/shared/utils/inputSanitizer.ts`.
