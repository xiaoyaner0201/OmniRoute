# Resilience Guide

OmniRoute has three distinct but related resilience mechanisms. Each has a different scope and purpose. Keep them separate when debugging routing behavior.

![3-layer resilience model](../diagrams/exported/resilience-3layers.svg)

> Source: [diagrams/resilience-3layers.mmd](../diagrams/resilience-3layers.mmd)

## 1. Provider Circuit Breaker

**Scope:** entire provider (e.g., `glm`, `openai`, `anthropic`).

**Purpose:** stop sending traffic to a provider that is repeatedly failing at the upstream/service level.

**Implementation:**

- Core class: `src/shared/utils/circuitBreaker.ts`
- Wiring: `src/sse/handlers/chatHelpers.ts`, `src/sse/handlers/chat.ts`
- Status API: `GET /api/monitoring/health`
- Reset API: `POST /api/resilience/reset`
- Wrappers: `open-sse/services/accountFallback.ts`
- DB table: `domain_circuit_breakers`

**States:**

- `CLOSED` — normal traffic allowed
- `DEGRADED` — traffic still allowed, but elevated provider failures are being tracked
- `OPEN` — provider temporarily blocked; combo routing skips it
- `HALF_OPEN` — reset timeout elapsed; probe request allowed

**Configurable defaults (`open-sse/config/constants.ts`, exposed in Dashboard → Settings → Resilience):**

| Class   | Degraded at | Opens at    | Reset timeout |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| OAuth   | 5 failures  | 8 failures  | 60s           |
| API-key | 7 failures  | 12 failures | 30s           |
| Local   | derived     | 2 failures  | 15s           |

`degradationThreshold` controls when a provider enters `DEGRADED`; `failureThreshold` controls when it opens and is skipped. Local provider profiles are not exposed on the Resilience settings page yet.

**Trip codes:** only provider-level statuses `[408, 500, 502, 503, 504]`. Do NOT trip for account-level errors (most 401/403/429 — those belong to cooldown or lockout).

**Lazy recovery:** when `OPEN` expires, `getStatus()`, `canExecute()`, `getRetryAfterMs()` refresh state to `HALF_OPEN`. No background timer needed.

---

## 2. Connection Cooldown

**Scope:** single provider connection/account/key.

**Purpose:** skip one bad key while other connections for the same provider keep serving.

**Implementation:**

- Mark unavailable: `src/sse/services/auth.ts::markAccountUnavailable()`
- Selection: `getProviderCredentials*` in same file
- Cooldown calc: `open-sse/services/accountFallback.ts::checkFallbackError()`
- Settings: `src/lib/resilience/settings.ts`

**Fields per connection:**

- `rateLimitedUntil` — timestamp until cooldown expires
- `testStatus: "unavailable"`
- `lastError`, `lastErrorType`, `errorCode`
- `backoffLevel` — exponential backoff counter

**Default cooldowns:**

- OAuth base: 5s
- API-key base: 3s
- API-key 429: prefers upstream `Retry-After`/reset headers/parseable reset text
- Backoff: `baseCooldownMs * 2 ** failureIndex`

**Anti-thundering-herd guard:** prevents concurrent failures from over-extending cooldown or double-incrementing `backoffLevel`.

**Terminal states (NOT cooldowns):**

- `banned` — set by banned-keyword / account-ban detection (see [BAN_DETECTION](../security/BAN_DETECTION.md))
- `expired`
- `credits_exhausted`

These persist until credentials change or an operator resets them. Do not overwrite terminal states with transient cooldown state.

**Lazy recovery:** when `rateLimitedUntil` is past, connection becomes eligible again. On successful use, `clearAccountError()` clears all error fields.

### Session affinity (#7274)

**Scope:** one client session (`X-Session-Id` / `x-codex-session-id` / `x-omniroute-session` header) pinned to one connection, for **any** provider.

**Purpose:** keep a multi-turn agent (Claude Code, aider, custom agents) on the same account across requests, reducing cross-account context loss and repeated cold-start 429s on providers with per-account session state.

**Implementation:**

- TTL resolution: `src/sse/services/sessionAffinityPin.ts::resolveSessionAffinityTtlMs()`
- Pin selection/creation: `src/sse/services/sessionAffinityPin.ts::selectSessionAffinityConnection()`
- Header extraction (generic, any provider): `src/sse/services/auth.ts::extractSessionAffinityKey()`
- Persisted pin table: `sessionAccountAffinity` (`src/lib/db/sessionAccountAffinity.ts`)
- Setting: `sessionAffinityTtlMs` (global TTL in ms, `0` disables) — `src/lib/db/settings.ts`. Renamed from the Codex-only `codexSessionAffinityTtlMs` by migration `124_generic_session_affinity_ttl.sql`, which carries over any previously-configured Codex TTL as the new default.

Before #7274, `resolveSessionAffinityTtlMs()` hard-bailed to `0` for every provider except `codex`, so the TTL setting (and the session headers) had no effect anywhere else even though the pinning mechanism and header extraction were already provider-agnostic. The fix removed that early-return; the TTL now applies uniformly to every provider once set globally above `0`.

The three session-affinity headers are never forwarded upstream — executors build their own upstream headers from scratch rather than passing client headers through, so this stays an internal correlation id only.

---

## 3. Model Lockout

**Scope:** provider + connection + model triple.

**Purpose:** avoid disabling a whole connection when only one model is unavailable or quota-limited.

**Examples:**

- Per-model quota providers returning 429
- Local providers returning 404 for one missing model
- Provider-specific mode/model permission failures (e.g., Grok modes)

**Implementation:** `open-sse/services/accountFallback.ts` — `lockModel()`, `clearModelLock()`, `getAllModelLockouts()`.

### Model Cooldowns Dashboard (v3.8.0)

UI: Settings → Model Cooldowns (`src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/settings/components/ModelCooldownsCard.tsx`)

Lists active lockouts with: provider, connection, model, reason, expiresAt. Operators can manually re-enable a model from the card.

**REST API:**

- `GET /api/resilience/model-cooldowns` — list active lockouts
- `DELETE /api/resilience/model-cooldowns` — manual re-enable. Body: `{provider, connection, model}`. Auth: management.

### Lockout settings UI + success-decay recovery (v3.8.23)

Model lockout went from always-on hardcoded behavior to a fully configurable,
opt-in feature with its own settings card and a self-healing recovery path.

**Settings card:** Settings → Model Lockout
(`src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/settings/components/ModelLockoutCard.tsx`).
This is **distinct** from the read-only `ModelCooldownsCard` above (which only
_lists_ active lockouts) — the new card _configures the parameters_. Defaults
live in `DEFAULT_MODEL_LOCKOUT_SETTINGS`
(`src/lib/resilience/modelLockoutSettings.ts`):

| Setting                 | Default                          | Meaning                                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`               | `false`                          | Master toggle — model lockout is **off by default**.           |
| `errorCodes`            | `[403, 404, 429, 502, 503, 504]` | Upstream statuses that count as a model-scoped failure.        |
| `baseCooldownMs`        | `120_000` (120 s)                | Initial lockout duration for the first failure.                |
| `maxCooldownMs`         | `1_800_000` (30 min)             | Cap on the escalated cooldown.                                 |
| `maxBackoffSteps`       | `10`                             | Max exponential-backoff escalation steps.                      |
| `useExponentialBackoff` | `true`                           | Whether repeated failures escalate the cooldown exponentially. |

Settings persist through the normal settings store and validate via the
resilience settings schema; the card clamps `baseCooldownMs`/`maxCooldownMs`
(with `maxCooldownMs ≥ baseCooldownMs`) and `maxBackoffSteps`.

**Success-decay recovery:** recovery is **not** purely timer expiry. A healthy
response walks the model's failure count back down so a model that recovered
mid-window stops escalating (and clears) before its timer would. On a successful
combo target, `open-sse/services/combo.ts` calls `decayModelFailureCount()`
(`open-sse/services/accountFallback.ts`), which **halves** the stored
`failureCount` (`Math.floor(failureCount / 2)`); when it reaches `0` the lockout
entry is deleted entirely. The counterpart `recordModelLockoutFailure()`
increments the count (and escalates the cooldown) on failures within the
escalation window. This success-decay is in addition to plain timer expiry —
either path can re-enable a model.

**State:** lockouts are held **in-memory** (per-process `Map`s of
`ModelLockoutEntry` keyed by `provider:connectionId:model`), not persisted to
the DB — they are lost on restart. The _settings_ are persisted; the active
lockout _state_ is ephemeral.

---

## 4. Quota-Share Concurrency Control (v3.8.36)

Subscription accounts (GLM, MiniMax, etc.) often accept only ~1–3 concurrent
requests; exceeding that triggers 429s and cooldowns. This is acute under
**quota-share** (`qtSd/…`) combos, where several API keys share one upstream
account. Three layers keep a shared account from being flooded.

### Per-connection concurrency cap (`max_concurrent`)

Each provider connection can declare a `max_concurrent` ceiling
(`provider_connections.max_concurrent`, set in the connection modal / API / DB).
Leave it empty for no limit. This is the single knob that drives the serialization
layer below — set it to the account's real concurrency (e.g. GLM ~1, MiniMax ~2).

### Quota-share request serialization

When a quota-share dispatch targets a connection that declares a positive
`max_concurrent`, concurrent requests to that **account** are serialized through a
per-connection semaphore (key `qsconn:<connectionId>`): excess requests **wait in
the queue** instead of flooding the account. It is **fail-open** — a saturated
queue or timeout proceeds without a slot rather than ever rejecting a dispatchable
request. Toggle in **Settings → Resilience → Quota-share per-connection
concurrency** (`resilienceSettings.quotaShareConcurrencyLimit.enabled`, default
on). Without a `max_concurrent` cap the behavior is unchanged.

> The quota-share routing gate (`selectQuotaShareTarget`, DRR + P2C) is itself
> fail-open and only _deprioritizes_ an at-cap connection — with a
> single-connection pool it cannot hard-limit, so this semaphore is what actually
> contains the flood.

### Combo cooldown-aware retry

For every combo strategy (when enabled), a request that would crystallize a 429
for a SHORT transient cooldown waits it out and re-dispatches instead of
returning the 429 — this covers Gemini-class TPM/RPM windows (~60s retry-after)
on multi-model combos, e.g. both targets of a 2-model combo hitting a per-model
rate limit. Bounded by `comboCooldownWait` (`enabled`, `maxWaitMs`, `maxAttempts`,
`budgetMs`) in **Settings → Resilience**. It never waits on `quota_exhausted`
(locked until midnight) or auth/not-found reasons.

---

## 5. Request Queue Admission Control (v3.8.49 · issue #6593)

**Scope**: the local per-provider+connection rate-limit queue (`open-sse/services/rateLimitManager.ts`,
backed by Bottleneck), one layer below the three mechanisms above.

**`maxWaitMs` is a legacy persisted name for execution expiration.**
`resilienceSettings.requestQueue.maxWaitMs` is passed to Bottleneck as a job
`expiration`, whose timer starts only after dispatch. It therefore bounds
limiter-managed execution, not time spent in the local queue. Expiration is
surfaced as trusted local `code: "RATE_LIMIT_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT"` (HTTP 504);
the former queue-timeout code name is accepted only for trusted internal
backward compatibility. The default is 15000ms; override via
`RATE_LIMIT_MAX_WAIT_MS` (env) or the dashboard (**Settings → Resilience**,
1–30000ms UI ceiling). Queue residence has no time deadline; use
`maxQueueDepth` below to bound queued callers.

**`maxQueueDepth` — opt-in admission cap (new).** `resilienceSettings.requestQueue.maxQueueDepth`
bounds how many requests may sit queued (not yet dispatched) for one
provider+connection at once. When the queue already holds `maxQueueDepth`
requests, a new request is fast-rejected with a typed
`code: "RATE_LIMIT_QUEUE_FULL"` error **before** it ever reaches `limiter.schedule()`
— so the rejection is cheap and happens ahead of any downstream
prompt-compression / translation work for that request. Default `0` =
disabled, preserving the existing unbounded-queue behavior; bounded 0–100000.
Override via `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH` (env) or
`resilienceSettings.requestQueue.maxQueueDepth` (dashboard/API patch).

The admission check itself is a pure function
(`open-sse/services/rateLimitManager/admission.ts::checkQueueAdmission`) so
it is unit-testable without a real Bottleneck limiter.

> The RFC that opened #6593 also proposed a `bypassCompressionOnRateLimit`
> flag. This repo's `open-sse/services/compression/` pipeline is
> prompt/context compression on the outbound LLM request (`chatCore.ts`,
> around the `resolveCompressionSettings`/`selectCompressionStrategy` block),
> not HTTP response compression on synthesized 429 bodies — there is no
> matching code path for a literal bypass flag. That prompt-compression step
> also currently runs _before_ `withRateLimit()` in the request pipeline, so
> reordering to skip it on a queue-full rejection is a separate, larger
> change than this issue's scope; it was intentionally **not** implemented
> here and is left as a follow-up if the CPU-saving win is worth the
> reordering risk.

## 6. Slow-stream throughput watchdog (#9709)

The optional `resilienceSettings.streamRecovery.throughputWatchdog` guard detects
an upstream that is still sending chunks but producing assistant output below the
configured useful-output rate. It is deliberately distinct from the idle timeout:
heartbeats and metadata reset neither timer and do not count as progress. It is also
distinct from the hard attempt deadline (#9153), which remains an absolute safety
ceiling regardless of output quality.

The watchdog requires a warm-up period followed by a complete rolling window before
it can abort. It counts text deltas from Chat Completions and Responses API output
events (a conservative UTF-8 byte proxy), ignores usage-only and empty events, and
suspends judgement while tool-call or reasoning events are in flight. It is disabled
by default and can be enabled with `STREAM_THROUGHPUT_WATCHDOG_ENABLED=true`; the
window, warm-up, minimum rate, and minimum measurable output are bounded by the
normal resilience-settings normalization layer.

When enabled, a watchdog abort is applied only to the active upstream attempt. Before
any client-visible bytes, the existing same-account early-recovery path may reopen
the attempt. After commit, the stream is never blindly replayed; only the existing
safe mid-stream continuation contract can stitch a suffix. Finalization remains
single-shot, so usage accounting and semaphore release are not duplicated.

---

## 7. Upstream Status Restatement (misstated quota errors)

**Scope:** one upstream gateway that reports temporary quota exhaustion with the wrong HTTP status.

**Purpose:** correct a misleading status BEFORE classification, so downstream consumers (fallback engine, combo aggregation, the client-facing response) see the true retryable nature of the failure.

Some gateways signal TEMPORARY quota exhaustion with a non-retryable HTTP
status. `agentrouter.org` returns `403` (sometimes `400`) with a Chinese body
(`用户额度不足` / `额度不足`) instead of the standard `429`. Clients like Claude
Code treat `403` as permanent and abort the session, and without correction
the fallback engine would classify it as `AUTH_ERROR` instead of a quota
event.

**Implementation:**

- Registry + matcher: `open-sse/config/upstreamStatusRestatement.ts` — a
  per-provider list of rules (`{id, fromStatuses, toStatus, textMarkers,
excludeMarkers, defaultRetryAfterMs}`), matched via `applyStatusRestatement()`.
- Call site: the `providerFailure:` block in `open-sse/handlers/chatCore.ts`
  (around line 3654), right after `parseUpstreamError()` parses an upstream
  response with an error HTTP status (`!providerResponse.ok`), and before any
  classification runs, so every downstream consumer sees the corrected
  status. Errors embedded inside a `200` SSE stream follow a separate,
  later stream-parsing path and are **not** covered by this hook today — a
  known limitation, not yet needed for agentrouter's misstatus (which
  surfaces as an error HTTP status).
- Retry eligibility: `429` is in `RETRY_AFTER_ELIGIBLE_STATUSES`
  (`open-sse/services/combo/unavailableRetryGate.ts`), so a restated error
  carries a real retry window instead of surfacing as a dead `403`.
- The synthetic `60s` `defaultRetryAfterMs` (`upstreamStatusRestatement.ts`)
  is only what the restated response tells the **client**; it is not itself
  the connection's internal cooldown/lockout duration — that is governed
  separately by whichever mechanism actually handles the restated error
  (Connection Cooldown's escalating backoff, §2, base `3s` for API-key
  providers; or Model Lockout, §3, for per-model-quota providers like
  agentrouter). The router can become eligible to retry internally sooner
  than the 60s window it advertises to the client — intentional headroom,
  not a bug.

Permanent errors (agentrouter's `无权访问模型` — no access to this model) are
NEVER restated: `excludeMarkers` vetoes the rule even when `textMarkers` hit,
so the error keeps its original status and nothing retries it forever. The
matching provider classification rule
(`agentrouter-model-access-denied` in `open-sse/config/providerErrorRules.ts`:
`reason: "auth_error"`, `scope: "model"`, a `6h` declared base cooldown) is
consulted by `checkFallbackError` (`open-sse/services/accountFallback.ts`)
*before* the generic apikey-category `FORBIDDEN` early-return, gated on
`honorsRuleLockScope(provider)` (#10334 — currently agentrouter-exclusive via
the `HONORS_RULE_LOCK_SCOPE_PROVIDERS` allowlist in
`providerErrorRules.ts`). The rule's declared 6h cooldown flows through as
`fallbackResult.baseCooldownMs`, but it still feeds the pre-existing
per-model-quota lockout path (`lockModelIfPerModelQuota()` /
`recordModelLockoutFailure()`, unchanged by #10334 except for the cooldown
source): it is clamped down to the operator's `mlSettings.maxCooldownMs`
(default `1_800_000ms` / 30min), like every other model lockout, and the
*persisted lockout reason* stays the pre-existing hardcoded `"forbidden"`,
not the rule's `"auth_error"` — only the cooldown duration is honored
end-to-end, not the reason string. The connection itself stays active;
sibling models on the same connection are unaffected.

Restated quota errors (`额度不足`) reach a provider rule in production
(`agentrouter-user-quota-exhausted`: `reason: "quota_exhausted"`, `scope:
"connection"`, no declared cooldown of its own — the persistence layer's
scaled backoff default applies). Since #10334, `scope` on
`ProviderErrorRuleMatch` IS consumed end-to-end, but **only** for providers in
the `HONORS_RULE_LOCK_SCOPE_PROVIDERS` allowlist (`providerErrorRules.ts` —
today only `"agentrouter"`, gated via `honorsRuleLockScope()`). For every
other provider `scope` remains informational, exactly as before #10334.
`checkFallbackError` surfaces the matched rule's scope as
`fallbackResult.ruleScope`; `isAgentrouterConnectionQuotaScope()`
(`src/sse/services/auth.ts`) is the shared guard that confirms a
`ruleScope` is genuinely safe to honor as a connection-wide, self-recovering
signal (scope `"connection"`, reason `quota_exhausted`, never `permanent`,
never `creditsExhausted` — a defense against a future rule pairing scope
`"connection"` with a permanent account state). Two consumers call it:

- **Persistence** (`markAccountUnavailable()`, `src/sse/services/auth.ts`):
  instead of falling into the passthrough-provider **per-model** lockout
  branch (agentrouter is `passthroughModels: true` → `hasPerModelQuota()`
  returns `true`), it applies a **temporary connection cooldown** —
  `testStatus: "unavailable"` + `rateLimitedUntil`, never a terminal status
  (`credits_exhausted`/`banned`/`expired`) — so the connection self-recovers
  once the cooldown lapses instead of requiring a manual credential reset.
  Skipped for connections with `disableCooling: true` (#2997): that opt-out
  falls through to the per-model lockout instead (a documented trade-off —
  see the code comment above the branch).
- **Same-request combo routing** (`applyComboTargetExhaustion()`,
  `open-sse/services/combo/targetExhaustion.ts`): the same guard marks the
  connection into the in-memory `exhaustedConnections` set, keyed
  `${provider}:${connectionId}`. This only skips a remaining SAME-REQUEST
  target that *itself already carries that exact `connectionId`* on its own
  target object (`getExhaustedTargetSkipReason()`,
  `open-sse/services/combo/comboPredicates.ts`, `if (provider &&
connectionId)` before the `exhaustedConnections` lookup) — a plain
  model-list combo, where sibling targets carry no pinned `connectionId` of
  their own and one is only resolved per-dispatch from the response's
  `X-OmniRoute-Selected-Connection-Id` header, never hits that key match. For
  that common case, the real protection against a remaining leg reusing the
  just-exhausted account is NOT this Set — it is the persistence layer above
  (the connection's `rateLimitedUntil` is now in the future) combined with
  this same guard suppressing `transientRateLimitedProviders` for the
  failure (see "Two-stage design" and the code comment on the
  `isAgentrouterConnectionQuotaScope` branch in `targetExhaustion.ts`): with
  that Set left unmarked, `combo.ts`'s `allowRateLimitedConnection` force-allow
  (`open-sse/services/combo.ts:1005-1013`, `:2734-2738`) does NOT kick in for
  the provider's remaining legs, so credential selection's `rateLimitedUntil`
  filter (`src/sse/services/auth.ts:1238`) is honored normally and a
  remaining leg either picks a different, still-eligible agentrouter
  connection or fails with no credentials available — it does not force its
  way back onto the connection this branch just cooled down.

### Two-stage design: status restatement, then classification

Status restatement (`upstreamStatusRestatement.ts`) and provider
classification rules (`open-sse/config/providerErrorRules.ts`,
`providerRuleRegistry`) are separate registries that both key on provider id
and text markers, but they run in different places and serve different
purposes: restatement rewrites the HTTP status early in `chatCore.ts`;
classification rules pick the fallback `reason` and lock `scope`
(`model` / `provider` / `connection`) inside `checkFallbackError()`
(`open-sse/services/accountFallback.ts`).

Classification rules only see full error **text** (needed to match body
markers like `额度不足`) for providers listed in the `FULL_TEXT_RULE_PROVIDERS`
allowlist in `providerErrorRules.ts` — currently only `"agentrouter"`. For
every other provider, `checkFallbackError` hands `getProviderErrorRuleMatch`
only the structured error (`{code, type}`), which is enough for
header/status/code-based rules but blind to body-text markers. The helper
`resolveRuleMatchBody()` performs this selection: full error text for
allowlisted providers, the structured error otherwise. Adding a provider to
`FULL_TEXT_RULE_PROVIDERS` is an explicit per-provider opt-in — it exists so
that the default path for every provider not on the list stays
byte-for-byte unchanged.

A rule's `scope` (`model` / `provider` / `connection`) is a separate opt-in
from `FULL_TEXT_RULE_PROVIDERS`: `checkFallbackError` only surfaces it as
`fallbackResult.ruleScope`, and downstream consumers only honor it as
anything other than an informational label, for providers in the
`HONORS_RULE_LOCK_SCOPE_PROVIDERS` allowlist in the same file (`gated via
honorsRuleLockScope()` — today only `"agentrouter"`). See "Restated quota
errors" above for what a `scope: "connection"` match actually does once a
provider is on that allowlist.

### Adding a new quota-misstating gateway

1. Register one rule array in `statusRestatementRegistry`
   (`open-sse/config/upstreamStatusRestatement.ts`). Keep `textMarkers`
   provider-specific; never reuse generic English phrases that collide with
   `CREDITS_EXHAUSTED_SIGNALS` (`open-sse/services/accountFallback.ts`).
2. Optionally register classification rules in
   `open-sse/config/providerErrorRules.ts` (`providerRuleRegistry`) to pick
   the right lock scope (`connection` for account-wide quota, `model` for
   per-model errors). This step only takes effect in production for
   providers whose rules need the full error text (body markers): add the
   provider id to `FULL_TEXT_RULE_PROVIDERS` in the same file — otherwise
   `checkFallbackError` only ever hands the rule the structured
   `{code, type}` error and a body-text rule will never match live traffic.
   Rules that match purely on `status`/`headers` (like Opencode's or
   Minimax's) do not need this opt-in. Separately, if the rule declares
   `scope: "connection"` and the intent is an actual connection-wide cooldown
   plus same-request combo skip (not just an informational label), add the
   provider id to `HONORS_RULE_LOCK_SCOPE_PROVIDERS` in the same file — this
   is what gates `isAgentrouterConnectionQuotaScope()`-style consumption in
   `markAccountUnavailable()` (`src/sse/services/auth.ts`) and
   `applyComboTargetExhaustion()`
   (`open-sse/services/combo/targetExhaustion.ts`); without it, `scope`
   still flows through `fallbackResult.ruleScope` but nothing acts on it.
3. Add unit tests mirroring `tests/unit/upstream-status-restatement.test.ts`
   and `tests/unit/agentrouter-error-rules.test.ts` (including the
   not-permanent / not-creditsExhausted guards, and — if the provider needs
   the allowlist — a test asserting `resolveRuleMatchBody()` returns the
   full text only for that provider).

No changes to `chatCore.ts`, `classifyError`, or combo are needed.

## Other Resilience Features

- **19 routing strategies** (priority, weighted, round-robin, context-relay, fill-first, p2c, random, least-used, cost-optimized, reset-aware, reset-window, headroom, strict-random, auto, lkgp, context-optimized, cache-optimized, fusion, pipeline) — see [AUTO-COMBO.md](../routing/AUTO-COMBO.md).
- **Reset-aware routing** (v3.8.0) — prioritizes connections by quota reset time.
- **Background mode degradation** — Responses API `background: true` degraded to sync with warning.
- **Dynamic tool limit detection** — backs off providers when tool count limits hit.
- **Emergency fallback** — controlled by `OMNIROUTE_EMERGENCY_FALLBACK`; operators can override it from the Feature Flags page without a restart.

---

## Debugging

- All keys for a provider skipped → check both circuit breaker state AND each connection's `rateLimitedUntil`/`testStatus`.
- Provider permanently excluded after reset window → code reading raw `state` instead of `getStatus()`/`canExecute()`.
- One key fails, others should work → prefer connection cooldown over circuit breaker.
- Only one model fails → prefer model lockout over connection cooldown.
- State should self-recover but doesn't → check for future timestamp + read path that refreshes expired state. Permanent statuses require manual changes.

## TLS Fingerprinting & Stealth

Provider-specific stealth (JA3/JA4, CCH, obfuscation) is separately documented — see [STEALTH_GUIDE.md](../security/STEALTH_GUIDE.md).

## Resilience testing (Phase 8 · Block C)

Beyond unit tests for resilience logic, three tests exercise the runtime under
real stress/failure conditions (all integration/nightly — none block PRs):

| Chaos       | Fake-upstream node injects real latency/reset/timeout/503; validates that the circuit breaker opens/recovers and `checkFallbackError` classifies 503 as recoverable fallback. | `RUN_CHAOS_INT=1 npm run test:chaos`     |
| Heap-growth | ~500 streams per `createSSEStream` under `--expose-gc`; fails if the heap grows beyond the ceiling (OOM guard #3069).                                                         | `npm run test:heap`                      |
| k6 soak     | Sustained load against `/api/monitoring/health`; p95/error thresholds.                                                                                                        | `k6 run tests/load/k6-soak.js` (nightly) |

Orchestrated by `.github/workflows/nightly-resilience.yml` (cron + dispatch). In the
default `test:integration`, chaos and heap self-skip (without `RUN_CHAOS_INT`/`--expose-gc`).
